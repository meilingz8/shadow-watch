**Right now, hundreds of invisible companies are watching exactly what you're reading, buying, and thinking about — without your knowledge.**

**ShadowWatch makes them visible. In real time. By name.**

## 👁 What Is ShadowWatch?

ShadowWatch is a **Chrome browser extension** that intercepts every network request your browser makes and tells you — in plain English — exactly which companies are collecting your data as you browse.

Not technical jargon. Not IP addresses. **Names.**

> *"Facebook Pixel is tracking your purchases right now."*
> *"TikTok's surveillance pixel just loaded on this news site."*
> *"This page uses Canvas fingerprinting — a tracking method that survives clearing your cookies."*

<br/>

## ⚡ Features

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

**🔴 Real-Time Tracker Feed**
Live, scrolling feed of every surveillance company active on the current page — updated as you browse, sorted by severity.

</td>
<td width="50%">

**👆 Fingerprint Detection**
Catches Canvas, WebGL, and Audio fingerprinting attempts — tracking methods that survive incognito mode and cookie deletion.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

**📊 Risk Score**
A 0–100 risk score per page based on tracker severity. Critical data brokers score high. CDN infrastructure scores low. No guessing.

</td>
<td width="50%">

**🛡 One-Click Blocking**
Block all detected trackers on a page instantly using Chrome's declarativeNetRequest API — the same engine used by uBlock Origin.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

**📅 7-Day History**
Bar chart and daily breakdown of every surveillance event across the past week. See which sites are the worst offenders.

</td>
<td width="50%">

**🔔 Daily Summary**
End-of-day notification telling you how many tracker events occurred, which company watched you most, and your daily risk score.

</tr>

## 🚀 Installation

> **Chrome Web Store listing coming soon.** Until then, install in 60 seconds via Developer Mode:

**1. Download**

Go to [**Releases**](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/shadowwatch/releases/tag/v1.0) and download `shadowwatch_v1.0.zip`

**2. Unzip**

Extract the ZIP file. You should see `manifest.json` directly inside the extracted folder.

**3. Load in Chrome**

```
chrome://extensions/  →  Developer mode ON  →  Load unpacked  →  select the extracted folder
```

**4. Start browsing**

Pin ShadowWatch to your toolbar. Navigate to any website. Watch the trackers appear.

<br/>

## 🔍 How It Works

```
Your browser makes a request
         ↓
ShadowWatch intercepts it (chrome.webRequest)
         ↓
Checks against database of 80+ known tracker domains
         ↓
Matches? → Identifies company, category, severity, data types
         ↓
Displays in real-time feed with plain-English description
         ↓
Stores locally (chrome.storage.local) — nothing leaves your device
```

**Fingerprint detection** works differently — a content script patches browser APIs at page load time, before any scripts run:

| API Patched | Detects |
|---|---|
| `HTMLCanvasElement.toDataURL` | Canvas fingerprinting |
| `WebGLRenderingContext.getParameter` | WebGL hardware fingerprinting |
| `AudioContext.createOscillator` | Audio fingerprinting |
| `document.fonts.check` | Font enumeration |

<br/>

## 📋 Tracker Categories

| Category | Icon | Examples | Risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| Data Broker | 🗃️ | Acxiom, LiveRamp, Experian | 🔴 Critical |
| Fingerprinting | 👆 | FingerprintJS, iovation | 🔴 Critical |
| Ad Network | 📢 | Google Ads, Facebook Pixel, Criteo | 🟠 High |
| Session Recording | 📹 | Hotjar, FullStory, Microsoft Clarity | 🟠 High |
| Ad Exchange | ⚡ | Magnite, PubMatic, OpenX | 🟠 High |
| Analytics | 📊 | Google Analytics, Mixpanel, Amplitude | 🟡 Medium |
| Social | 🔗 | Disqus, AddThis, Twitter | 🟡 Medium |
| CRM | 📧 | HubSpot, Intercom, Marketo | 🟡 Medium |
| CDN / Infrastructure | 🌐 | Cloudflare, Fastly | 🟢 Low |

<br/>

## 🛡 Privacy Promise

ShadowWatch was built to expose surveillance. It would be deeply ironic if it were itself a surveillance tool.

| Commitment | Status |
|---|---|
| All data stored locally on your device | ✅ |
| Zero data transmitted to ShadowWatch servers | ✅ |
| No account required | ✅ |
| No ads, ever | ✅ |
| No telemetry or usage tracking | ✅ |
| Full source code available here | ✅ |

Every piece of data ShadowWatch collects — tracker events, history, settings — lives exclusively in `chrome.storage.local` on your machine. We have no servers receiving user data because we built none.
